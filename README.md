Atmosphere is a POJO based framework using Inversion of Control (IoC) to bring Push/Comet and Websocket to the masses! Finally a framework which can run on any Java based Web Server, including Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish, Weblogic, Netty, JBossWeb and JBoss, Resin, etc. without having to learn how Comet or WebSocket support has been differently implemented by all those Containers. The Atmosphere Framework has both client (Javascript, JQuery, GWT) and server components.

Framework like Jersey, GWT, Wicket, Vaadin, Guice, Spring, JSF, Scalatra, Grails etc are supported. You can use Scala, JRuby, Groovy and Java to write Atmosphere application. Massive scalability with our Cluster plugin architecture (JGroups, JMS/ActiveMQ, Redis, XMPP, etc.)
